"If anyone wants to hook their actual printer up to _why’s queue (which I’m pretty sure is what he intended), iandennismiller transcribed the OCaml program in SPOOL/HOMEWORK which polls whytheluckystiff.net and sends the PCL files to your printer: https://github.com/cwales/cwales.github.com/pull/4 

It’s quite magical. I was woken up this morning by my printer, when the first pages were being published. Now every 5, 10, or 15 minutes my printer starts clanking away (it’s an old one) and a brand new page slowly emerges. Great way to read a novel, if that’s what it is."

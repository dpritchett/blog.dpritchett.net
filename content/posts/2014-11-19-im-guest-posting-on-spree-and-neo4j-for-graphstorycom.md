I've recently been working with some friends at a local startup called Graph Story.  They provide a hosted graph database solution using Neo4j.  They are looking to build up some introductory content to help developers get started with graph databases, so I wrote them a series of posts.  Here's the first in the series: [Graph Kit for Ruby Part 1: Letâ€™s Build a Recommendation Engine for a Spree Store](https://www.graphstory.com/site/wp/2014/11/17/graph-kit-for-ruby-part-1-lets-build-a-recommendation-engine-for-a-spree-store/)

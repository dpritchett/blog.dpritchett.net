My good buddy and local Ruby luminary Jason Charnes has recently announced that he's bringing the Ruby conference circuit back to Tennessee!  Do yourselves a favor and go sign up right now at [SoutheastRuby.com](https://southeastruby.com/)!  WIth Avdi Grimm as the first announced keynote and a cool venue like Ruby Nashville it's sure to be a godo time.  Plus, my personal experience with PyTennessee has convinced me that Nashville is a pretty cool spot to spend a weekend.  See you there!

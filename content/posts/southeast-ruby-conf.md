My good buddy and [local Ruby luminary Jason Charnes](https://twitter.com/jmcharnes) has recently announced that he's bringing the Ruby conference circuit back to Tennessee!  Do yourselves a favor and go sign up right now at [SoutheastRuby.com](https://southeastruby.com/)!  With [Avdi Grimm as the first announced keynote](http://www.virtuouscode.com/) and a cool venue called Ruby in Nashville it's sure to be a godo time.  Plus, my personal experience with PyTennessee has convinced me that Nashville is generally a pretty cool spot to spend a weekend.  See you there!
